      <p>
        Good foods for swimming include pasta, sandwiches, fruits and veggies, cereal, and yogurt. If you want that extra dose of energy before 
        your swim, I recommend eating pasta, or anything with carbs. I know something that helped me during the swim season was eating a bagel 
        before my workout. It made my experience with swimming so much better. When it comes to swimming, carbohydrates are your best friend. 
        Don’t forget about chocolate milk! Milk has lots of nutrients. It is a great protein source. Chocolate milk has a great flavor. 
        I’d recommend drinking it after your workout. You can, of course, supplement it with a protein drink, but that is up to you.

        Swimming is by far one of the best sports that will work most of your whole body. It even works the smaller muscles that support your 
        joints. I say this from experience. After a workout, if I didn’t stretch, the parts that I worked the most will be aching. Like other 
        sports, stretching is a must. If you don’t do it, you are just hurting yourself.
        
        I know shopping for swimwear and gear can be tricky. In my experience, I have had to gone through at least 50 pairs of goggles. Some places that are good for shopping for swimwear are 
        amazon.com, swimoutlet.com, us.speedo.com, and arenasport.com.
        
        From my experience, there were some things I didn’t like about swimming. 
        One of those is having to always put lotion on. Your skin will get dry. Another thing is having a runny nose all the time. You will 
        constantly have to blow your nose. The last thing is being tired. This depends on how much sleep you get. If you are planning to swim 
        the next day, please just make sure to get a good night’s rest.

      <h3>Strokes Page</h3>
      <!-- Strokes -->
      <p>
        When it comes to talking about swim strokes, they each have their own function of what muscles they work. 
        The strokes that I will be addressing are Butterfly, Backstroke, Breaststroke, and Freestyle (the 4 main strokes).
       
        Butterfly
        This stroke works your core and lower back. The core and lower back lift your body out of the water upwards. 
        The glutes control your legs; they keep them together. Your pectorals, lats, hamstrings, calves, shoulders, biceps, 
        and triceps get worked hard when performing this stroke correctly. In my opinion, this stroke is painful, but when 
        you get good at it, it can be fast.

        Breaststroke
        The middle and lower back muscles are used with every cycle of arm stroke you do (pectorals and latissimus). When kicking, 
        the glutes and quads are the main muscles that do the work.

        Backstroke and Freestyle
        These 2 strokes are very similar. The only difference between them is that you are either laying on your front or back. With 
        each cycle of stroke, your biceps, triceps, and back muscles are doing most of the work. When you want to breath, you have 
        to use your neck muscles to turn your head. It is recommended when doing these 2 strokes that you have your hips high. This helps 
        you float and glide through the water efficiently. It will also just make the stroke way less tiring (it will feel like 
        you are doing less work). When kicking, the muscles that are used are the quads, hamstrings, and calves.
