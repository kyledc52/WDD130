                <!-- Intro -->
                <p>
                    Swimming is by far one of the best sports that will work most of your body. It even works the smaller muscles that support your 
                    joints. I say this from experience. After a workout, if I didn't stretch, the parts that I worked the most will be aching. Like other 
                    sports, stretching is a must. If you don't do it, you are just hurting yourself.<br>
                    From my experience, there were some things I didn't like about swimming. 
                    One of those is having to always put lotion on. Your skin will get dry. Another thing is having a runny nose all the time. You will 
                    constantly have to blow your nose. The last thing is being tired. This depends on how much sleep you get. If you are planning to swim 
                    the next day, please just make sure to get a good night's rest.

                    <h3>Foods</h2>
                </section>
                <p>
                    Good foods for swimming include pasta, sandwiches, fruits and veggies, cereal, and yogurt. If you want that extra dose of energy before 
                    your swim, I recommend eating pasta, or anything with carbs. I know something that helped me during the swim season was eating a bagel 
                    before my workout. It made my experience with swimming so much better. When it comes to swimming, carbohydrates are your best friend. 
                    Don't forget about chocolate milk! Milk has lots of nutrients. It is a great protein source. Chocolate milk has a great flavor. 
                    I'd recommend drinking it after your workout. You can, of course, supplement it with a protein drink, but that is up to you.

                    <p>
                        I know shopping for swimwear and gear can be tricky. In my experience, I have had to gone through at least 50 pairs of 
                        goggles. Some places that are good for shopping for swimwear are:
                        <ul>
                            <li><a>amazon.com</a></li>
                            <li><a>swimoutlet.com</a></li>
                            <li><a>us.speedo.com</a></li>
                            <li><a>arenasport.com</a></li>
                        </ul>
