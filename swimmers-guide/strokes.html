                <p>
                    When it comes to talking about swim strokes, they each have their own function of what muscles they work. 
                    The strokes that I will be addressing are Butterfly, Backstroke, Breaststroke, and Freestyle (the 4 main strokes).

                </section>
                <p>
                    This stroke works your core and lower back. The core and lower back lift your body out of the water upwards. 
                    The glutes control your legs; they keep them together. Your pectorals, lats, hamstrings, calves, shoulders, biceps, 
                    and triceps get worked hard when performing this stroke correctly. In my opinion, this stroke is painful, but when 
                    you get good at it, it can be fast.

                    <h3>Breaststroke</h3>
                </section>
                <p>
                    The middle and lower back muscles are used with every cycle of arm stroke you do (pectorals and latissimus). When kicking, 
                    the glutes and quads are the main muscles that do the work.

                <p>
                    These 2 strokes are very similar. The only difference between them is that you are either laying on your front or back. With 
                    each cycle of stroke, your biceps, triceps, and back muscles are doing most of the work. When you want to breath, you have 
                    to use your neck muscles to turn your head. It is recommended when doing these 2 strokes that you have your hips high. This 
                    helps you float and glide through the water efficiently. It will also just make the stroke way less tiring (it will feel like 
                    you are doing less work). When kicking, the muscles that are used are the quads, hamstrings, and calves.
