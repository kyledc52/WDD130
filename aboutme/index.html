        <p>Hi! My name is Kyle Carroll. I am from Great Falls, Montana. I am a freshman (first semester) who's 19 years old. I actually got my mission call thus last week! I got called the Columbus, Ohio mission. My start date is January 23rd. I am so excited but also nervous. My major is Computer Science. I was going to minor in music but decided to just stick with CS. I know 2 languages in CS (java and python). I love singing; I did choir all 4 years of high school. Im also a 4-year varsity letter winner for swimming, so that's cool I guess. I have 4 sisters and no brother. I am right in the middle. So yeah, that's me!</p>
